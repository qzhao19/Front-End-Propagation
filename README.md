# front-end-propagation
Simulation of front-end propagation
# Overview

This projet aims to solve the problem of front-end propagation, which could be modeled by the following partial differential equation called $\Eikonal Equation$ $ \w_t(t, x, y)+F(x, y)||\Delta_{x}w(t, x, y)||^2=0, w(0, x, y)=\phi{(x, y)}$
